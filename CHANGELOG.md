# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.2.0] - 2026-05-13

- Ability to control the rejections of unathorized XMPP servers (`options.rejectUnauthorized` e.g. for the reason of invalid certificates)
- Adjust the compatibility issues with OpenClaw v2026.5.7

## [4.1.0] - 2026-02-17

### Changed

- Version bump to 4.1.0

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **XEP-0444 Reactions: send as plaintext siblings** — Reactions are now sent as plaintext `<reactions>` elements as siblings to the OMEMO `<encrypted>` element, NOT inside the encrypted payload. This matches native client behavior (Gajim, Conversations) where reactions are sent unencrypted alongside an OMEMO message. The OMEMO payload is kept minimal (empty) to maintain session continuity while reactions appear as proper emoji reactions to recipients.

## [0.3.9] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Reactions: wrap in SCE envelope per XEP-0420** — The OMEMO-encrypted reaction payload now properly wraps the `<reactions>` element in a Stanza Content Encryption (SCE) `<envelope><content>` structure. This matches the XEP-0420 profile that native XMPP clients expect. Without this wrapper, the raw `<reactions>` XML inside the encrypted payload wasn't being parsed correctly by clients like Gajim and Conversations.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Reactions: put `<reactions>` inside OMEMO encrypted payload** — Previously the `<reactions>` element was sent as a plaintext sibling to `<encrypted>`, which most XMPP clients ignore. Now the reactions XML is encrypted as the payload content, matching how native clients send OMEMO-encrypted reactions.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Reactions: strip `xmpp:` channel prefix from target JID** — The LLM passes JIDs with the `xmpp:` channel prefix (e.g., `xmpp:user@server`), which was leaking into the `to` attribute of the reaction stanza. The prefix is now stripped in all code paths.
- **Reactions: OMEMO-encrypt reaction stanzas** — When OMEMO is active, Gajim and Conversations silently drop plaintext stanzas from contacts with established OMEMO sessions. Reaction stanzas are now wrapped in OMEMO encryption (empty payload with `<reactions>` sibling), matching what native XMPP clients expect.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Reactions: use XEP-0359 stanza-id for message references** — The `<reactions>` stanza now references the server-assigned `stanza-id` (XEP-0359) instead of the sender's stanza `id` attribute. Most XMPP clients (Conversations, Gajim, Dino) index messages by stanza-id, so reactions referencing the wrong ID were silently ignored.
- **MessageSid prefers stanza-id** — The `MessageSid` field in OpenClaw context now uses the server-assigned stanza-id when available, making the LLM's message references match what the receiving client expects.
- **Action handler logging** — Added console logging to `handleXmppAction` for debugging reaction delivery (logs target JID, messageId, emoji, and the full stanza).

## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Actions: never throw, always return `jsonResult()`** — Every error path in `handleAction` / `handleXmppAction` now returns `jsonResult({ ok: false, error })` instead of throwing. This ensures `toolResult` messages in the session history always have a `content[]` array, preventing the LLM provider crash (`msg.content.filter(...)` on undefined). Old sessions with broken tool results from pre-v0.3.4 may still trigger this — start a fresh conversation to clear them.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **Actions crash: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')"** — `handleAction` now returns proper `AgentToolResult` via `jsonResult()` instead of a plain object; errors are thrown instead of returned (matching WhatsApp/BlueBubbles pattern)
- **SDK type declarations** — Added `jsonResult` export to `declarations.d.ts`

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **XEP-0333 Read Receipts** — Bot sends `displayed` chat markers for incoming DMs
  - New `sendReadReceipts` config option (default `true`), configurable at root and per-account level
  - Follows WhatsApp channel parity: defaults on, skips group chats, errors are non-fatal
- **XEP-0444 Inbound reaction detection** — Incoming reactions are logged and skipped (no AI processing)

### Fixed

- **OMEMO fallback body suppression** — No longer processes plaintext `<body>` on OMEMO-encrypted stanzas (prevents AI from responding to "I sent you an encrypted message" notices)
- **Actions adapter improvements** — Correct `type` attribute on reaction stanzas (`chat`/`groupchat`), added `<store>` hint (XEP-0334), improved target resolution with `toolContext` fallback, bare JID normalization

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-11

### Changed

- **Renamed config fields** — Eliminated confusing "MUC" terminology from user-facing config
  - `mucs` → `groups` (room JID list)
  - `groups` → `groupSettings` (per-room config like tools, requireMention)
  - `mucNick` → `nickname` (display name in group chats)
- **Separated owner list from DM allowlist** — `allowFrom` is now strictly for bot owners (cannot be removed by the agent); new `dmAllowlist` field for JIDs allowed to direct-chat when `dmPolicy` is `"allowlist"`
  - Prevents accidental owner lockout if a guest asks the agent to remove a JID
  - `allowFrom` = bot owners (immutable, always have access)
  - `dmAllowlist` = guest-level DM access list (managed separately)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-08

### Changed

- **Unified access model** — Removed separate `dms` config field; `allowFrom` now serves as both bot-owner list and direct chat allowlist
  - `allowFrom` = bot owners (always have direct chat access)
  - `dmPolicy` = controls guest access (JIDs not in allowFrom): open, disabled, pairing, allowlist
- **Improved onboarding** — Wizard now asks for owner JIDs first, then guest policy in a logical order; eliminated duplicate DM policy prompt
- **Updated terminology** — "DMs" → "direct chats" throughout user-facing messages and docs

### Refactored

- **Shared utilities** — Extracted duplicated `toBase64`, `fromBase64`, `getElementText`, `extractErrorText`, `iqId`, `waitForIq` into shared `xml-utils.ts` module
- **Dynamic version** — `iq-handlers.ts` now reads plugin version from `package.json` instead of hardcoded constant

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **OMEMO Encryption (XEP-0384)**
  - End-to-end encryption using the Signal protocol
  - Uses legacy namespace `eu.siacs.conversations.axolotl` for Conversations/Gajim compatibility
  - Automatic device ID and key bundle publication via PEP
  - Automatic decryption of incoming OMEMO messages
  - Automatic encryption of outgoing messages when OMEMO is enabled
  - Group chat encryption with per-occupant key distribution

  - Device list caching with PEP subscription for updates
  - Group room occupant tracking for real JID discovery (non-anonymous rooms)
  - Self-encryption support for multi-device scenarios
  - Configurable device label for OMEMO device list

### Fixed

- Skip group self-echo messages before OMEMO decryption (prevents "decrypt on sending chain" errors)
- Skip group history messages before OMEMO decryption (forward secrecy prevents decryption of old messages)

### Technical Details

- AES-128-GCM for payload encryption (legacy OMEMO 0.3 format)
- Supports both prekey and regular Signal messages

  - `reconnect.ts` — Exponential backoff logic
  - `chat-state.ts` — Typing indicators and read receipts
